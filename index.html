        <h1>A Little About Jordan</h1>

        <p>I am a guy who <strong>loves</strong> snowboarding, wake surfing and hanging out with friends.</p>
            <h2>Some of my favorite foods include:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Carne Asada Tacos</li>
                    <li>Breakfast Burritos</li>
                    <li>Cheesecake</li>
                    <li>Any kind of Asian food without mushrooms</li>
                </ul>
    <p>I have lived in Colorado for a good amount of time these past few years.
        During that period I got to learn many new skills such as how to snowboard instruct,
        how to video edit, and bartend. I hope to translate the video editing and web development
        into a way to make a business for aerospace marketing.</p>
